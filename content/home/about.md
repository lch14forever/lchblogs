# Biography


I am a bioinformatician and Ph.D student from Computational and System Biology Group 5 (CSB5), Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS). I graduated from Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore (NUS), majored in computational biology, after which I decided to seek after a career as a researcher.
I am interested in abroad range of biological problems. I believe that all biological processes will leave some clues. By investigating such clues, we can not only identify the indicators of the biological process (i.e. biomarkers), but also understand the mechanism leads to the process. To this end, I employ techniques in mathematics, statistics and computer science to tackle biological problems of interest in the era of big data.
