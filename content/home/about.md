# Biography


I am currently a reasearch associate at the Laboratory of Metagenomic Technologies and Microbial Systems (fomerly CSB5), Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS). I graduated from National University of Singapore under the supervision of Dr. Niranjan Nagarajan and Professor Wong Lim Soon. I have a specific in studying microbial communities -- understanding their composition, function and dynamics.
